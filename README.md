# 🛡️ Blue Team Lab: Network Intrusion and Detection Project

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a full defensive security workflow:

- Attacker simulation
- IDS monitoring (Suricata)
- Host log analysis
- Event correlation
- Detection effectiveness reporting

The goal was to simulate real-world attack activity and perform structured SOC-style analysis using network and host telemetry.

---

# 🎯 Project Objectives

- Deploy and configure Suricata IDS
- Simulate realistic attacker activity
- Capture alerts in `fast.log`
- Correlate IDS alerts with host logs
- Produce professional SOC-style reports
- Evaluate detection coverage and effectiveness

# 🧪 Lab Environment

## Components

| Role | Technology |
|------|------------|
| Attacker | Kali Linux |
| Victim | Ubuntu Server |
| IDS | Suricata |
| Web Server | Apache2 |
| Log Sources | `fast.log`, `/var/log/auth.log`, `/var/log/apache2/access.log` |

---

## Tools Used
- VirtualBox
- Nmap
- Hydra
- Suricata

---

# 🚩 Phase 1 – Lab Setup

- Installed and configured Suricata on a dedicated Ubuntu server
- Enabled rule sets (Emerging Threats)
- Enabled promiscous mode on the network adapter to provide traffic visibility
- Verified logging to `fast.log`
- Deployed SSH and Apache services
- Validated network connectivity between attacker and victim

Artifacts:
- `defender/` defender artifacts
- `defender/ids/` Suricata setup

---

# 🔥 Phase 2 – Attack Simulation

Simulated real-world attacker behavior from Kali:

### Activities Performed

- ICMP reconnaissance
- Nmap SYN scan and service detection
- SSH brute-force using Hydra
- Web directory enumeration

Generated:
- Suricata alerts in `fast.log`
- SSH authentication failures in `/var/log/auth.log`
- Apache 404 logs in `/var/log/apache2/access.log`

Artifacts:
- `attacker/`

---

# 🧠 Phase 3 – Defender Analysis & Correlation

Performed structured SOC analysis using:

- Suricata `fast.log`
- SSH authentication logs (auth.log)
- Apache access logs (access.log)

### Analysis Completed

- Extracted IDS alerts
- Identified priority levels
- Correlated attacker IP across data sources
- Built unified attack timeline
- Evaluated detection coverage
- Produced incident summary report
