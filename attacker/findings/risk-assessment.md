# Risk Assessment

## Overview
The assessment identified externally accessible services that could be leveraged by an attacker for further compromise attempts.

## Risk Ratings

### SSH Brute Force Risk — Medium
- Password authentication enabled
- No visible rate limiting
- Susceptible to credential stuffing or brute-force attacks
- Impact dependent on password strength and monitoring

### Web Service Exposure — Low to Medium
- No sensitive content identified
- Potential attack surface for future vulnerabilities
- Could be leveraged for reconnaissance or exploitation if misconfigured

## Overall Risk Posture
The target system demonstrates a moderate security risk profile. While no critical vulnerabilities were exploited, the exposed services provide viable entry points for determined attackers.

## Recommendation
Continuous monitoring and intrusion detection are strongly recommended.
