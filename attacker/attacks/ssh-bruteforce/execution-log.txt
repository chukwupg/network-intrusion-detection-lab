Attack Execution Log

Attack Type: SSH Brute Force (Credential Guessing Simulation)
Target: 192.168.8.100
Service: SSH (Port 22)
Tool: Hydra
Date: 10/02/2026
Operator: External Attacker 

Command Executed:
hydra -l testuser -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://192.168.8.100

Execution Notes:
- A low thread count was intentionally used to avoid denial-of-service conditions.
- The attack simulated password guessing against a single username.
- No valid credentials were obtained.
- Multiple authentication failures were generated on the target system.

Observed Behavior:
- Target responded consistently to authentication attempts.
- No account lockout mechanism was observed during the limited attempt window.
- Attack window became unresponsive and the target unreachable due to the nature of the attack (unspecified thread count) which will most likely lead to a denial-of-service condition on the target.
- Authentication failures were logged server-side (validated in the next phase).

Result:
- Attack was unsuccessful.
- Traffic generated was sufficient for IDS detection and correlation.
